# Employee Tracker
### An employee database management script

This repository is for an employee database management project made for my UC Berkeley coding bootcamp. It features a command-line interface that allows the user to view and add to a database of employees as well as their roles and departments.

A video walkthrough is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YZ5M1qtE9cK9beivqbN6LjetJYaDmxqQ/view?usp=share_link).

There is no license for this project and it is intended for educational purposes only.
